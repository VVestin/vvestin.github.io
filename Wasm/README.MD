Wasm is an online IDE for a simplified version of z80 assembly created for educational purposes.
The assembler is designed to teach the fundamentals of computer hardware and assembly language to the
CS2 Class at Peak to Peak Charter School. Wasm is simple and user friendly yet still as powerful as z80
assembly and includes documentation and exercises within the application. This project shares a name and
loose similarities with, but has no relation to the assembly-like language for the web, WebAssembly.
